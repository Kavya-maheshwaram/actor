AI (Artificial Intelligence) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and problem-solve. It encompasses technologies like machine learning, neural networks, and natural language processing. AI can analyze large datasets, make decisions, and improve over time. Applications span from automation and robotics to healthcare, finance, and entertainment. While it offers immense benefits, ethical considerations and risks, such as bias and job displacement, are ongoing challenges.
